This is my WEB222 Final Project, I really like using JS, CSS and HTML for web design.
I was infected with COVID-19 during this assignment, but I still managed to complete this project thanks to my professor Blessing Ajiboye.

This assignment was completed by me personally, during which I obtained the consent of the Professor to view the relevant web pages and technologies.

For the form part, I read Aryan Khurana's code, stated here.

JavaScript CSS HTML is covered in this assignment
